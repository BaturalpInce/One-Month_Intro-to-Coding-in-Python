# One-Month_Intro-to-Coding-in-Python

### I will upload the things that I completed for the Intro to Coding in Python course on One Month to this repository. I can summarize the things that I learned shortly in 3 steps. 1) The syntax of Python 2) How to analyze data using Jupyter Notebook, Mathplotlib, Seaborn and Pandas 3) How to use Flask and connect it with API's. Thank you Mattan Griffel for creating this great course.
